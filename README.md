# Year 2 Group Research Project: Subset Selection and Shrinkage Methods in Regression
In the summer of 2022, I was assigned to a group of six to research on subset selection and shirnkage methods in regression under the supervision of Dr Kolyan Ray. Our report includes:
1. Introduction to the discrete subset selection methods (Forward Stepwise, Backward Stepwise, Stepwise, Forward Stagewise)
2. Introduction to the continuous shrinkage methods (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Least Angle Regression)
3. Introduction to measures of prediction accuracy (Mean Squared Error, Euclidean Norm, True Positive Rate, False Discovery Rate, Akaike Information Criterion, Mean Absoulte Error, Coefficient of Determination)
4. Numerical Simulations to compare the performance of the various subset selection and shrinkage methods on different cases
5. Applying the various subset selection and shrinkage methods to the Ozone Interaction Dataset

Our reserach was documented using LaTeX and a video presentation was recorded to share about our research. The group research project was awarded a first-class mark.
